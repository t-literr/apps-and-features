    <h1>Behaviors</h1>
    <section>
        <p>Behviors are special sets of classes that require more than one element. Each behaviour consists of at least one trigger and at least one target.</p>
        <p>Behviors enable functionailty that would otherwise require complex css or custom javascript. Behaviors are also contextually aware and may change according to the type of screen being used. For example, a hover trigger will have different effects
            on a touchscreen vs a regular monitor.
