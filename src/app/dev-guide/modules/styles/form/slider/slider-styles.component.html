        <span>let the user set a value in a given range by tapping—or scrubbing back and forth—on a track. 
            It provides a visual indication of adjustable content, as well as the current setting in the total range of content. (Ex. adjusting brightness).</span>

        <i>slider</i>
        <span>is a good choice when you know that users think of the value as a relative quantity, not a numeric value. For example, 
            users think about setting their audio volume to low or medium—not about setting the value to 2 or 5. </span>

    <p>
        <span>Use a</span>
        <i>slider</i>
        <span> if the user would benefit from instant feedback on the effect of setting changes. 
                For example, users can choose a color more easily by immediately seeing the effect of changes to hue, saturation, or luminosity values. 
                Only a step range of 1 is supported.
